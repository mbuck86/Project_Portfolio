# Project Portfolio
This is Michael Buck's data science project portfolio, containing major projects I have completed in my path to become a competent 
analyst. 

The primary contents of this portfolio are the two capstone projects that I have completed for Springboard's Data Science Career Track 
Course. Below I will provide a brief summary of each of the projects and descriptions of the files in their respective files.

Captsone 1:
In this project I used the lyrical data from the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 1965-2015 to construct a classification model whose goal was to determine what decade a song was from based on its lyrical content. You can read my final report which covers the highlights of the project and read through the powerpoint that I wrote to highlight some of the most impotant features.

If you would like to see the in depth portions of the project, each folder here encompasses a smaller part of the project that I had to complete and submit. The chronological order that each folder was written in is as follows:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Data Story
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. In-Depth Analysis
In each of those folders you will find a write-up that describes the coding steps that were taken to perform each step of the project as well as a jupyter notebook that contains all of the code that was written to accomplish each of those tasks. If you have any questions about the project feel free to contact me!

Capstone 2:

In this project I used data that was descriptive of the traits of a large number of vehicles to attempt to create a model to predict the 
MSRP of the vehicles. I then analyzed the feature importance of that model in an attempt to find the specific set of features that 
minimized the RMSE of the MSRP prediction using XGBoost. After finding the model that resulted in the smallest RMSE with these methods I performed some additional analysis on the model results, and all of the specifics of this project are outlined in the final report of this project which is in that folder in this repository. 
This project is only split into one milestone report, which described the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, and then the machine learning portion of the project, which shows the feature engineering portions of the project along with model creation and performance analysis. Both of those notebooks contain the code that I wrote to complete the project. I also created some visualizations in Tableau that are in the report and slide deck that I created for the project.
